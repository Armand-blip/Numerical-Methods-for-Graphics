# Numerical-Methods-for-Graphics
This is a project that I have done in the "Numerical Methods for Graphics" course.
I have build a program that make the automatic parkig in matlab without taking in consideration the speed of the car. The main idea is to show and interpret the dfference between a C^1 continous path and C^2 continous path. I have also defined the difference between a reference Path and a smoother Path using the automatic parking in Matlab.
The second file represents a parking maneuver in Matlab using the same inputs as in the first example.
